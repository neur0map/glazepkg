## Why?

You have `brew`, `pip`, `cargo`, `npm`, `apt`, maybe `flatpak` — all installing software independently. Knowing what's actually on your machine means running 6+ commands across different CLIs with different flags and output formats.

**GlazePKG fixes this.** One command, one view, every package. Track what changed over time with snapshots and diffs. Export everything to JSON for backup or migration.

## Features

- **31 package managers** — brew, pacman, AUR, apt, dnf, snap, pip, pipx, cargo, go, npm, pnpm, bun, flatpak, MacPorts, pkgsrc, opam, gem, pkg, composer, mas, apk, nix, conda/mamba, luarocks, winget, Chocolatey, Scoop, NuGet, PowerShell modules, Windows Update (+ brew dependency tracking)
- **Instant startup** — scans once, caches for 10 days, opens in milliseconds on repeat launches
- **Size filter** — press `f` to cycle through size filters (< 1 MB, 1–10 MB, 10–100 MB, > 100 MB, has updates); sorted largest-first
- **Fuzzy search** — find any package across all managers instantly with `/`
- **Snapshots & diffs** — save your system state, then diff to see what was added, removed, or upgraded
- **Update detection** — packages with available updates show a `↑` indicator (checked every 7 days)
- **Custom descriptions** — press `e` in the detail view to annotate any package; persists across sessions
- **Background descriptions** — package summaries load asynchronously and cache for 24 hours
- **Export** — dump your full package list to JSON or text for backup, migration, or dotfile tracking
- **Self-updating** — run `gpk update` to grab the latest release automatically
- **Tokyo Night theme** — carefully designed color palette with per-manager color coding
- **Vim keybindings** — `j`/`k`, `g`/`G`, `Ctrl+d`/`Ctrl+u` — feels like home
- **Zero dependencies** — single static Go binary, no runtime requirements
- **Cross-platform** — works on macOS, Linux, and Windows; skips managers that aren't installed

## Install

```bash
go install github.com/neur0map/glazepkg/cmd/gpk@latest
```

If `gpk` is not found after installing, add Go's bin directory to your PATH:

```bash
# bash (~/.bashrc) or zsh (~/.zshrc)
echo 'export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/go/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

```fish
# fish
fish_add_path ~/go/bin
```

```powershell
# PowerShell (Windows)
$env:PATH += ";$env:USERPROFILE\go\bin"
```

Or grab a [pre-built binary](https://github.com/neur0map/glazepkg/releases) for macOS (ARM/Intel) or Linux (x64/ARM).

Or build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neur0map/glazepkg.git
cd glazepkg && go build ./cmd/gpk
```

## Update

```bash
gpk update
```

Self-updates the binary to the latest release. Run `gpk version` to check your current version.

## Quick Start

```
gpk              Launch TUI
gpk update       Self-update to latest release
gpk version      Show current version
gpk --help       Show keybind reference
```

Just run `gpk` — it drops straight into a beautiful table. Navigate with `j`/`k`, switch managers with `Tab`, search with `/`, press `s` to snapshot, `d` to diff, `e` to export. Press `?` for the full keybind reference.

- Managers that aren't installed are silently skipped — no errors, no config needed.
- Brew separates explicitly installed formulae from auto-pulled dependencies — deps go in a dedicated **deps** tab.
- Descriptions are fetched in the background and cached for 24 hours.
- Packages with available updates show a `↑` indicator next to their version (checked every 7 days).
- Press `e` in the detail view to add custom descriptions — these persist across sessions and won't be overwritten.

| `Ctrl+d` / `Ctrl+u` | Half-page down / up |
| `PgDn` / `PgUp` | Page down / up |
| `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` | Cycle manager tabs |
| `f` | Cycle size filter |
| `/` | Fuzzy search |
| `Enter` | Package details |
| `e` (detail) | Edit description |

## Snapshots & Diffs

GlazePKG can track how your system changes over time:

1. **Snapshot** (`s`) — saves every package name, version, and source to a timestamped JSON file
2. **Diff** (`d`) — compares your current packages against the last snapshot, showing:
   - **Added** packages (new installs)
   - **Removed** packages (uninstalls)
   - **Upgraded** packages (version changes)

Use this to audit what changed after a `brew upgrade`, track drift across machines, or catch unexpected installs.

## Data Storage

All data lives under `~/.local/share/glazepkg/` (respects `XDG_DATA_HOME`):

| Data | Path | Retention |
|------|------|-----------|
| Scan cache | `cache/scan.json` | 10 days (auto-refresh) |
| Description cache | `cache/descriptions.json` | 24 hours |
| Update cache | `cache/updates.json` | 7 days |
| User notes | `notes.json` | Permanent |
| Snapshots | `snapshots/*.json` | Permanent |
| Exports | `exports/*.json` or `*.txt` | Permanent |
